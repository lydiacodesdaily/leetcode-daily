# ‚úÖ Problem:

# BFS Level Traversal (no dummy/prev needed in perfect tree)

# üîç Key Insight:
# - Since it's perfect, curr.left and curr.right always exist.
# - And curr.next.left will always be the immediate neighbor of curr.right.

# üß† Memory Hook:

# ‚úÖ Problem:
# - Not necessarily perfect; children can be missing.
# - Fill `.next` pointers to point to the node's right neighbor.

# üìö Pattern:
# BFS Level Traversal with Dummy + Prev pointer for next level

# üîç Key Insight:
# - Can't hardcode left/right links like 116; must "chain together" existing children.
# - Use dummy/prev to stitch next-level nodes in left-to-right order as we go.

# üß† Memory Hook:
# "Dummy = start of next row, Prev = tail; attach kids as we find them"

    def connect(self, root: 'Optional[Node]') -> 'Optional[Node]':

                curr = curr.next  # move to next node in current level
            
            curr = dummy.next    # move down to first node of next level
        
        return root

# ======================================================
# üí° Difference Summary:
# 116:
# - Tree is perfect ‚Üí direct links between left/right and across parents.
# - No dummy/prev needed because children always exist.
#
# 117:
# - Tree can be irregular ‚Üí can't assume neighbors exist.
# - Use dummy/prev to collect all next-level children in order.
# - prev.next = curr.left/right is literally "add this child to the end of the kid line".

1Ô∏è‚É£ How curr.next is created

Inside the outer loop, you have something like:

if curr.left:
    prev.next = curr.left
    prev = prev.next
if curr.right:
    prev.next = curr.right
    prev = prev.next

Here:
	‚Ä¢	prev starts as dummy (a placeholder node for the next level).
	‚Ä¢	The first child found (curr.left or curr.right) gets linked:
dummy.next = curr.left ‚Üí This is the start of the next level.
	‚Ä¢	Then for subsequent children, prev.next = child makes sure each child is connected to the next child in the same level.

So, curr.next for this level was already set in the previous pass when we were processing the previous level.

‚∏ª

2Ô∏è‚É£ Why curr = curr.next works

Let‚Äôs take an example:

Level 1:        1
               / \
Level 2:      2   3
             / \   \
Level 3:    4   5   7

First pass (level 1):
	‚Ä¢	Start curr = 1
	‚Ä¢	Connect 1.left (2) and 1.right (3) via prev.next
	‚Ä¢	After finishing, 2.next = 3 has been set.
	‚Ä¢	That‚Äôs why, in the next pass when curr = curr.next, curr can move from 2 to 3 without needing extra pointers right now ‚Äî because they‚Äôre already connected.

‚∏ª

3Ô∏è‚É£ Visual Linking Process

Processing Level 1:

dummy ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3

Processing Level 2:

dummy ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 5 ‚Üí 7

When you‚Äôre processing Level 2:
	‚Ä¢	Start with curr = 2
	‚Ä¢	After processing 2, curr = curr.next moves to 3
(because 2.next = 3 was set when we linked children during Level 1 processing)

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Key takeaway:
curr.next doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúmagically‚Äù exist ‚Äî it‚Äôs built while processing the previous level.
When you go through a level, you‚Äôre not only visiting nodes, you‚Äôre also stitching together the .next pointers for the next level so that the upcoming loop can simply walk across it.

‚∏ª

If you want, I can give you a dry run for 117 where I highlight exactly when each .next pointer is created, so you can see why curr = curr.next is valid at each step.
That would make this click 100%.
