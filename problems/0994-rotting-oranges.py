# LeetCode 994 - Rotting Oranges
# https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/

"""
‚úÖ Problem:
You are given an m x n grid where:
  - 0 = empty cell
  - 1 = fresh orange
  - 2 = rotten orange

Every minute, any fresh orange that is 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten one becomes rotten.
Return the minimum number of minutes until no cell has a fresh orange.
If impossible, return -1.

üìö Pattern:
Grid BFS (multi-source)

üîç Key Insight:
- Start BFS from *all* initially rotten oranges (multi-source BFS).
- Each BFS level = 1 minute.
- Keep track of fresh oranges count ‚Äî stop when all rotten or BFS ends.

üß† Memory Hook:
"Multi-source BFS = spread from all rotters at once"
(Level order traversal for time steps)

‚úÖ Time Complexity: O(m * n) ‚Äî each cell visited once
‚úÖ Space Complexity: O(m * n) ‚Äî queue + visited set

# LeetCode 994 - Rotting Oranges
# https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/
#
# ‚úÖ Pattern:
# BFS in a Grid (Multi-source BFS)
#
# üîç Key Insight:
# - All initially rotten oranges rot their adjacent fresh oranges at the same time.
# - This is a classic **multi-source BFS**: enqueue all rotten oranges first, then spread in layers.
# - Track time by counting BFS levels.
#
# üß† Memory Hook:
# "Start with all rotten in queue ‚Üí BFS level = minutes passed ‚Üí Spread until no fresh left"
#
# ‚úÖ Time Complexity: O(m * n) ‚Äî each cell is processed at most once
# ‚úÖ Space Complexity: O(m * n) ‚Äî for the BFS queue
#
# üìå Edge Cases:
# 1. No fresh oranges at start ‚Üí return 0
# 2. Fresh oranges exist but no rotten ones ‚Üí return -1
# 3. Grid is all empty cells ‚Üí return 0
