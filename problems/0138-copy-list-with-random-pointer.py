# LeetCode 138 â€“ Copy List with Random Pointer
# âœ… HashMap-based approach for clarity and simplicity
# ðŸ§  Time Complexity: O(n) â€“ we visit each node twice
# ðŸ“¦ Space Complexity: O(n) â€“ we store a mapping from original -> copied nodes
# ðŸ“Œ Use Case: When correctness and clarity are prioritized, especially in early interview stages

# ðŸ§ª Dry Run Example:
# Original: 7 â†’ 13 â†’ 11 â†’ 10 â†’ 1
# Random:    â†˜    â†˜    â†–    â†˜
#           None   7   1   11
# After pass 1: cloned nodes created but not linked
# After pass 2: next and random pointers set using mapping
