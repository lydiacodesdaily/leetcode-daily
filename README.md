# 🧠 Lydia's LeetCode Daily Log (2025– )

Hi! I’m Lydia — a senior software engineer building deeper mastery in algorithms, system design, and technical interviewing.

This repo is a **daily log of my LeetCode + technical interview preparation journey**, with joining AI-forward organizations like OpenAI - and creating a more inclusive tech world for neurodivergent developers like myself.

### `problems/`
Deep dives into specific LeetCode problems. Each file includes:
- Problem summary
- Pattern identification
- Key mistakes and gotchas
- Code with comments and dry runs

### `patterns/`
My personalized notes and templates for common coding interview patterns (e.g. sliding window, binary search, tree traversal). Meant to be ADHD-friendly and easy to review.

## 🔁 Study Principles

- **Pattern-first** approach: I organize problems by problem-solving strategy, not just difficulty.
- **Review > New**: I repeat previously solved problems before adding new ones to reinforce memory.
- **Minimal friction**: I use a lightweight Notion + Anki + GitHub flow to stay focused.
- **Document to learn**: Writing is my way of thinking — this repo is both a reflection and a resource.
