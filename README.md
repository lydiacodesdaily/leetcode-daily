## 🔁 Study Principles

- **Pattern-first** approach: I organize problems by problem-solving strategy, not just difficulty.
- **Review > New**: I repeat previously solved problems before adding new ones to reinforce memory.
- **Minimal friction**: I use a lightweight Notion + Anki + GitHub flow to stay focused.
- **Document to learn**: Writing is my way of thinking — this repo is both a reflection and a resource.
