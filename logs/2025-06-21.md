# ðŸ“… Daily Log - June 21, 2025 (Saturday)

**Total Study Time:** 8.6 hours  
**Material Covered:**  
- 40 Meta-tagged LeetCode Anki flashcards  
- Meta interview preparation

## âœ… Key Accomplishments:
- Reviewed and practiced 40 Meta-tagged LeetCode flashcards.
- Deepened understanding of when DFS/BFS is essential:
  - **When DFS/BFS is Needed:**
    - Problems like **Clone Graph** involve non-linear, cyclic structures.
    - DFS or BFS is required to fully traverse all neighbors while avoiding infinite loops.
    - For problems like **Copy List with Random Pointer**, DFS/BFS is not necessary because:
      - The random pointers do not create traversable cycles.
      - We only copy the random pointer values without walking through them like graph edges.

## ðŸ’­ Reflections:
- Overall, a **productive day.**
- Started to **panic** as I encountered some questions Iâ€™ve repeatedly forgotten despite solving them multiple times.
- Noticing the **importance of spaced repetition** and tightening the memory hooks for these problem patterns.
- Interview anxiety is building, but Iâ€™m pushing forward.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Focus for Tomorrow:
- Continue reviewing Meta-tagged flashcards.
- Prioritize revisiting problems I tend to forget.
- Consider a focused Anki review on weak spots.
- Integrate calming strategies to manage interview stress.
