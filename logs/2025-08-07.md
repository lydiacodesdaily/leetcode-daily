**Total Hours:** 11.75  
- **Leetcode:** 8.75 hrs  
- **System Design:** 3 hrs

## Morning
Panicked for an hour after realizing that the Meta-tagged Leetcode list has shifted so much — many new questions have entered the **Top 100–200 range** since I last refreshed it.

Right now, there are **~60 new problems** to go through in the 100–200 range, and new ones keep popping up.  

**Strategy going forward:**  
- **First pass:** go through all new problems quickly to get exposure.  
- **Second + Third pass:** use repetition + pattern mastery to reinforce. This might sacrifice depth at first, but it should maximize coverage before the interview. Risky, but necessary given the time crunch.

## Leetcode (21 problems)

1. **285. Inorder Successor in BST** ✅  
2. **510. Inorder Successor in BST II** ✅  
3. **485. Max Consecutive Ones** ✅  
4. **487. Max Consecutive Ones II** ✅  
5. **1004. Max Consecutive Ones III** ✅  
6. **399. Evaluate Division** ❌ *Extremely difficult — resolve later*  
7. **341. Flatten Nested List Iterator** ❌ *Hard — needs revisit*  
8. **179. Largest Number** ✅ *Custom comparator (`functools.cmp_to_key`)*  
9. **151. Reverse Words in a String** ✅  
10. **116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node** ✅  
11. **117. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II** ✅ *(Dry run clarified `curr = curr.next` from `prev.next` chain)*  
12. **1110. Delete Nodes And Return Forest** ✅ *(Only roots of remaining trees are added to forest)*  
13. **490. The Maze** ✅ *(BFS with rolling stop cells — fixed misplaced `return False`)*  
14. **16. 3Sum Closest** ✅ *(Same pattern as 3Sum, except tracking min diff instead of exact match)*  
15. **2566. Maximum Difference by Remapping a Digit** ✅ *(Bug was replacing digits multiple times — fixed)*  
16. **2094. Finding 3-Digit Even Numbers** ✅ *(~450 iterations from 10×10×10 possibilities)*  
17. **1838. Frequency of the Most Frequent Element** ✅ *(Understood cost formula but needs repetition)*  
18. **1443. Minimum Time to Collect All Apples in a Tree** ✅ *(DFS returning edge cost if apple in subtree)*  
19. **1071. Greatest Common Divisor of Strings** ✅ *(`math.gcd` gives length of GCD substring)*  
20. **994. Rotting Oranges** ✅ *(BFS with minute increments after each level)*  
21. **525. Contiguous Array** ✅ *Still not fully grasping prefix sum + first occurrence mapping — redo*

## Reflection
- **Win:** All 21 problems solved today were **new problems** — great coverage.  
- **Extra Win:** Been getting up earlier these past few days, gaining more study time.  
- **Adjustment for Tomorrow:**  
  1. Work from the refreshed list daily to avoid missing new high-frequency problems.  
  2. Do stepper + system design videos right after lunch.  
  3. Consider splitting system design into two shorter blocks sandwiched between Leetcode sessions for better retention.
