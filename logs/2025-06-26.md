## âœ… Summary:
Today was a highly focused and productive day.  
I tackled several new and challenging problems and made substantial progress on topics that initially felt intimidating.

### Wins:
- ðŸš€ Maintained deep focus throughout the day without taking long breaks.
- âœ… Solved new and difficult problems like **Sliding Window Median** by first mastering the brute force version and understanding the outline of the optimal two heaps solution.
- âœ… Gained clarity on problems that required switching from DFS to BFS, like **Vertical Order Traversal of a Binary Tree** and **Exclusive Time of Functions**.
- âœ… Corrected misunderstandings regarding **circular linked lists** and binary search tree traversal.

## âœ… Study Strategies That Worked:
- âœ¨ **Skipping Long Breaks:** I confirmed that short snack breaks are more effective than stepping away for long periods.
- âœ¨ **Eating Strategically:** Eating small bites throughout the day helped me avoid losing 1-2 hours to full meal breaks.
- âœ¨ **Writing Out Stress:** Using ChatGPT to offload stress and quickly receive actionable study strategies worked well, especially for approaching intimidating problems like Sliding Window Median.
- âœ¨ **Stacking Learning:** Started with brute force versions to build confidence before attempting optimal solutions.

## âœ… Key Problem Annotations:
| Problem | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| [LeetCode 480 - Sliding Window Median](https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-median/) | Initially intimidating. Brute force mastered (O(nk log k)), focused on learning the outline of the two heaps solution (O(n log k)). |
| [LeetCode 987 - Vertical Order Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/vertical-order-traversal-of-a-binary-tree/) | New problem. Learned why BFS is necessary to maintain column order. |
| [LeetCode 636 - Exclusive Time of Functions](https://leetcode.com/problems/exclusive-time-of-functions/) | New problem. Understood that start and end times are both inclusive. Important to update `prev_time` carefully. |
| [LeetCode 708 - Insert into a Sorted Circular Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-into-a-sorted-circular-linked-list/) | Learned how to handle wrap-around and edge cases in a circular linked list. |
| [LeetCode 270 - Closest Binary Search Tree Value](https://leetcode.com/problems/closest-binary-search-tree-value/) | Initially thought I needed DFS. Learned that this is a binary search simulation on a BST. |
| [LeetCode 489 - Robot Room Cleaner](https://leetcode.com/problems/robot-room-cleaner/) | New problem. Mastered DFS traversal with careful backtracking and virtual grid tracking. |

## âœ… Additional Reflections:
- I realized that **taking long breaks actually derails my momentum.** I will continue to limit breaks to very short intervals moving forward.
- I confirmed that **small meal strategies reduce snacking and wasted time.** I plan to prep food in advance and snack in place while studying.
- I experienced a **personal win by working through my initial stress and breaking down large problems into smaller, manageable pieces.**
- **TMI note:** I had some physical discomfort last night from eating too quickly but learned from it. I plan to adjust my bedtime routine to allow for earlier sleep since my body naturally wakes up around 7 AM.
