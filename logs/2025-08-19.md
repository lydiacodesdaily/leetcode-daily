## 🎤 Behavioral Interview — 0.5 hr
- Watched Matt Huang video (behavioral prep).

## 🏗 System Design — 3.75 hrs
**Grokking Modern System Design Interview**
- CDN articles  
- Reviewed all common system design blocks again  
- Sharded counters  

**Notes:**  
- Worked on building a **System Design Template**.  
- Still feeling somewhat scatter-brained despite reviewing multiple resources — need to consolidate knowledge into repeatable patterns.

## 🔢 LeetCode — 6 hrs

### 🆕 New Problems (SQL focus today)
- Q1: 1757. Recyclable and Low Fat Products  
- Q2: 595. Big Countries  
- Q3: 1148. Article Views I  
- Q4: 176. Second Highest Salary  
  - Explored multiple approaches:  
    - **`LIMIT + OFFSET`** → best for interviews (short, clean).  
    - **`MAX … WHERE salary < MAX(salary)`** → also clear.  
    - (Optional: window functions with `DENSE_RANK`, but less common in MySQL).  
- Q5: 570. Managers with at Least 5 Direct Reports  
- Q6: 1070. Product Sales Analysis III  

**SQL Prep Notes:**  
- I initially skipped SQL related questions as I thought I won't need to prep these, but it's better to be safe than sorry.
- Researched whether to prep in **MySQL vs PostgreSQL** → decided on **MySQL** since LeetCode uses it.
- Quick review with **W3Schools MySQL tutorials & quizzes** to refresh.

### 🔄 Review from Yesterday
- Q1: 419. Battleships in a Board  
  - Key insight: only count `X` when no `X` above and no `X` to the left.  
- Q2: 210. Course Schedule II  
  - Fixed bug: must iterate indices for in-degree, not values.  
- Q3: 545. Boundary of Binary Tree  
  - Boundary = root + left (no leaves) + all leaves + reversed right (no leaves).  
- Q4: 148. Sort List  
  - Best approach: merge sort with slow/fast pointer split and dummy node merge.
