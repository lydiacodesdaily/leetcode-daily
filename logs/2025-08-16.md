## 📝 Reflection
I finally feel like I’m back to my normal pace after the stress of the ceiling/fiberglass issue earlier this week. Today was solidly productive. Even though I woke up 2–3 times in the evening, I still got more rest than the past few days, and it showed in my focus.  

I’ve been experimenting with a **switching content study method** — going back and forth between system design and LeetCode. Because of this, it’s hard to measure exactly how much time I spent on each. That said, I leaned a bit more on **LeetCode** today.  

Had some good clarifications during LeetCode study:  
- Revisited **Power of Two** and understood why `n & (n - 1)` works.  
- Discussed **Missing Number** and why XOR vs Sum both solve it, plus set-based approach.  
- Dug deeper into **Count and Say**, clarifying why the loop builds from term 2 → n, and how the indexing avoids out-of-range errors.  

Overall, I feel more stable, caught up, and productive.
