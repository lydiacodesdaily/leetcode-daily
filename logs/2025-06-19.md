## ✅ Topics Studied & LeetCode Problems Solved

1. **Greedy + Prefix Sum (Difference Array)**  
   - [Car Pooling](https://leetcode.com/problems/car-pooling/)  
   - ➕ Created a new pattern category: `Prefix Sum (Difference Array)` for problems that use cumulative deltas across arrays.

2. **String Manipulation & Parsing**  
   - [Longest Common Prefix](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix/)  
   - [String to Integer (atoi)](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-to-integer-atoi/)  
   - 🔍 Reviewed overflow guard using `(INT_MAX - digit) // 10`, and meaning of `atoi`.

3. **Two Pointers**  
   - [Squares of a Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/squares-of-a-sorted-array/)  
   - [Interval List Intersections](https://leetcode.com/problems/interval-list-intersections/)  
   - ✅ Did a dry run and fixed a bug in interval overlap logic (`min(end)` not `max(end)`).

4. **Stack + Tree Traversal**  
   - [Binary Search Tree Iterator](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search-tree-iterator/submissions/1669936011/)  
   - 🧠 Understood the role of lazy in-order traversal using a stack.  
   - 💡 Clarified: we push all the way to the leftmost node first to simulate in-order traversal.

5. **Stack (Nested Decoding)**  
   - [Decode String](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-string/description/)  
   - ✅ Mastered handling of nested encodings like `"3[a2[c]]"`.

6. **Greedy (Digit Swapping)**  
   - [Maximum Swap](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-swap/)  
   - 🔄 Understood why we use `list(str(num))` instead of `list(num)`, and how to update digits in-place.

7. **Two Pointers vs. Hash Map**  
   - [Dot Product of Two Sparse Vectors](https://leetcode.com/problems/dot-product-of-two-sparse-vectors/)  
   - 🆚 Compared two-pointer vs hashmap approach → preferred hashmap for simplicity.

8. **Greedy (Parentheses Balancing)**  
   - [Minimum Add to Make Parentheses Valid](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-add-to-make-parentheses-valid/)  
   - ✅ Preferred version with `open` and `insertions` for clearer logic.

9. **Sliding Window (Set-based version)**  
   - [Contains Duplicate II](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate-ii/description/)  
   - ✅ Chose `set()`-based sliding window version for clarity and alignment with common patterns.  
   - 🧠 Memory Hook:  
     ```python
     # use set() as window of size k  
     # if num already in window → duplicate within range → return True  
     # add num, remove leftmost if size > k
     ```

10. **Intervals + Two Pointers**  
    - [Interval List Intersections](https://leetcode.com/problems/interval-list-intersections/)  
    - ✅ Fixed logical bug (`end = min(...)`), did a full dry run.

🧠 **Reflection:**  
Focused heavily on mastering simulation-based problems, parsing logic, and interval merging. Solidified understanding of prefix sums and lazy in-order traversal. Reaffirmed preference for readable, pattern-based solutions even when simpler alternatives exist.
