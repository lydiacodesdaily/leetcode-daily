# 🗓️ Daily Log — August 10, 2025 (Sunday)

**Total:** 0.5 + 3 + 3.5 + 0.5 = **7.5 hours**

## 📌 Leetcode – 4 hours

**Problems Completed:**
1. **134. Gas Station** ✅ — Merged greedy version (track `total` + `tank` in one pass) with memory hook and dry run.
2. **643. Maximum Average Subarray I** ✅ — Sliding window, track `max_sum`, return `max_sum / k`.
3. **658. Find K Closest Elements** ✅ — Binary search on left bound; compare edges `(x - a)` vs `(b - x)`.
4. **825. Friends Of Appropriate Ages** ✅ — Counting + prefix sums, skip age < 15, `res += count[ageA] * (total_in_range - 1)`.
5. **55. Jump Game** ✅ — Greedy `max_reach` tracking, early return if `max_reach >= last index`.
6. **67. Add Binary** ✅ — Right-to-left addition with carry; used bit ops (`s & 1` for current bit, `s >> 1` for carry).

**Key improvements:**
- Added **time & space complexities** and **edge cases** to `.py` files for easier future review.
- Covered detailed **dry runs** for 134, 658, 825, and 55 to solidify reasoning.
- Clarified **74 vs 240** search patterns (binary search on flattened vs. staircase search).

## 🛠 System Design – 3.5 hours
- **Design Dropbox / Google Drive** – Hello Interview video:  
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UZ1ngy-kOI&t=456s&ab_channel=HelloInterview-SWEInterviewPreparation
- **ByteByteGo system design videos** – including Kafka deep dive and related architecture concepts.
- Reviewed general system design fundamentals, but still feel like “the click” hasn’t happened yet despite learning a lot.

## 🧠 Study Process Improvements
- Implemented **two short review sessions daily**:
  - **After lunch** → review morning’s materials.
  - **Before bed** → review afternoon/evening materials.
  - Also review material from **3 days ago** to strengthen retention.
- Review method: Open solved Leetcode problems, read the problem statement, recall approach, then check submissions. **No stress** or overthinking — kept it light.
- Realized importance of noting **time/space complexities** and **edge cases** in submissions for quick recall later.

## 😕 Reflection
- Weekend productivity was lower than expected, partly due to **self-doubt** (“I can’t do this, I’ll never pass”).
- Root cause: uncertainty about **system design** and **behavioral interviews** — still waiting for that mental “click” in system design.
