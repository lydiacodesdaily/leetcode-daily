# 📅 Daily Log – October 25, 2025 (Saturday)

**Total Hours:** 6.5  
- **Python / OOP Study:** 3 hrs  
- **LeetCode / Anki Review:** 2.5 hrs  
- **System Design:** 1 hr

## 🐍 Python / OOP Study
- Completed **NeetCode Python OOP – Classes & Objects** module  

🎯 Focused on class structure, constructors, and object instantiation. Improved understanding of encapsulation and real-world design examples in Python.

---

## 🧠 LeetCode / Anki Review
- 5 LeetCode cards  
  - `199.` Binary Tree Right Side View  
  - `670.` Maximum Swap  
  - `647.` Palindromic Substrings  
  - `271.` Encode and Decode Strings  
- 4 Python cards  

🕒 Reinforced binary tree traversal, string manipulation, and class-based problem-solving logic.

## 🏗️ System Design
- Attended **System Design Zoom Call (12 PM)** — found it not particularly useful or aligned with current preparation goals.

---

## 🪞 Reflection
Realized that learning advanced Python **purely through Anki flashcards** isn’t an effective approach for deeper understanding.  
Decided to switch to **structured learning via NeetCode Python OOP**, which provides clearer conceptual flow and practical examples.
