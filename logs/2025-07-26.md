## 📚 System Design (3.5 hours)
- 🧱 Created a **System Design Cheatsheet** covering:
  - Network fundamentals (DNS → CDN → Load Balancer → Server → DB)
  - Load balancing strategies (round-robin, least-connections, IP-hash)
  - Cache patterns (cache-aside, TTL, invalidation strategies)
  - Stateless vs stateful services
  - Async processing with queues
- 🎓 Studied with **HelloInterview system design modules**

## ✨ Reflections:
- Practiced two different deep copy techniques and dry ran the **Copy List with Random Pointer** problem.
- Successfully dry ran and explained **Sum Root to Leaf Numbers** using DFS with path sum tracking.
- Reinforced fast exponentiation and edge case handling in **Pow(x, n)**.
- System design study is starting to click — especially caching and network flow.
