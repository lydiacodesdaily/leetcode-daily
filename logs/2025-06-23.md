## âœ… Key Accomplishments:
- Reviewed **35 Meta-tagged LeetCode Anki flashcards.**
- Solidified key interview patterns including:
  - Prefix Sum (finally starting to make sense!)
  - Sliding Window
  - Binary Search nuances
- Focused review on:
  - LeetCode 560 - Subarray Sum Equals K
  - LeetCode 528 - Random Pick with Weight
    - Overcame initial freeze from "probability" language by breaking it down into prefix sum + random pick logic.

## âœ¨ Milestone Moment:
- **Meta rescheduled the interview to July 2!**  
  I kept telling myself I needed just one more week to prepare â€” and the universe actually delivered. I now have an extra week to sharpen skills and deeply review weak spots. Huge mental boost!

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings:
- Prefix Sum isnâ€™t scary â€” itâ€™s just saving earlier sums to speed up future calculations.
- Iâ€™m learning to separate "math language" from actual coding logic, which helps prevent me from freezing.
- Repeating the memory hooks, core ideas, and dry runs is making it easier to recall solutions quickly.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Focus for Tomorrow:
- Keep drilling through Meta-tagged Anki flashcards.
- Start writing and testing core patterns from scratch.
- Prioritize weak areas:  
  - Prefix Sum applications  
  - Probability-sounding problems (break them down to their mechanics)
