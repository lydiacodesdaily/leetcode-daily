# 🗓️ Daily Log — August 9, 2025 (Saturday)
**Total time studied:** 3.75 + 3 + 1.5 = **8.25 hours**

## 📚 Leetcode — 6.75 hours
1. **419. Battleships in a Board** — Done ✅  
   - Reviewed grid traversal logic and how to avoid counting the same ship multiple times.  
   - Reinforced importance of checking only "new" ships by looking at top and left neighbors.

2. **210. Course Schedule II** — Done ✅  
   - Similar to 207 (Course Schedule) but returns the actual course order.  
   - Practiced building `adj` (prerequisite → list of courses) and `in_degree` array.  
   - Memory hook: BFS using queue, push courses with `in_degree == 0`, decrease indegrees as prerequisites are satisfied.

3. **48. Rotate Image** — Done ✅  
   - Practiced in-place rotation: transpose + reverse each row.  
   - Key reminder: swapping indices carefully to avoid overwriting before rotation is complete.

4. **545. Boundary of Binary Tree** — Done ✅  
   - Learned anti-clockwise boundary collection: **root → left wall → leaves → right wall (reversed)**.  
   - Left/right boundary logic:  
     - Prefer left (or right), fallback to opposite side if missing.  
     - Skip leaves (to avoid duplicates).  
   - Fixed bug in `boundary` initialization to prevent duplicate root in single-node trees.  
   - Understood why `add_right_boundary` needs reversal (collected top-down but output bottom-up).  
   - Clarified why `add_leaves` recurses even when a node is not a leaf — ensures all leaves are included.

5. **148. Sort List** — Done ✅  
   - Reviewed merge sort for linked list: split using fast/slow, recursively sort halves, merge.

6. **311. Sparse Matrix Multiplication** — Done ✅  
   - Optimized by skipping zero elements in `A` to reduce unnecessary multiplications.

## 💭 Reflections
Today was **a very tough day** — focus was almost nonexistent.  
Tried taking breaks, getting fresh air, and eating, but still only managed 6 questions in nearly 7 hours.  
Concentration improved slightly during **system design videos** when paired with walking on steppers.  
Considering experimenting with a **walking pad** for problem-solving sessions to maintain energy and focus.
