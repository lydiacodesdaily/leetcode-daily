## ✅ What I Studied

### 🎟️ System Design – HelloInterview: Design Ticketmaster
**Time Spent:** 4.5 hrs

- Watched the explanation video at 1.5x speed while using the **stepper machine**.
- This combination was **surprisingly effective** — it helped prevent distractions and kept the video playing continuously.
- Afterwards, I sat down and used **Excalidraw** to sketch out the architecture from memory.
  - Rewatched sections of the video to take screenshots and notes.
  - The **recall process took longer than expected**, and I often got distracted during transitions between components.
  - Noticed I had to **exert more willpower** than usual to finish the visual note-taking phase.
  
🟡 **Reflection:**
- I'm really happy I found a **"dual-task" routine** (stepper + study) that worked well for both learning and completing my daily workout.
- I need to figure out a **better recall/jotting method** to reduce friction.

### 🔢 LeetCode – Problem #986: Interval List Intersections
**Time Spent:** 0.5 hrs

- Did one problem to maintain daily LeetCode practice.
- Chose a familiar pattern for low cognitive effort.
- Was feeling **physically stressed** due to a personal situation — pressure in neck, shoulders, and calves.
- Recognized that **pushing through wasn’t productive** and chose to rest instead of forcing more study time.

## 🧠 Strategy Notes

- ✅ **Keep combining workouts + passive video study** when possible — this helps minimize distraction and supports consistency.
- 🧩 For system design recall, I'll try:
  - Pre-drawn Excalidraw templates
  - Short 5-minute voice summaries before switching to visuals
  - Turn this into a speed game by trying to jot down everything I know within 5 minutes

## ❤️ Personal Reflection

> Despite stress, I stayed consistent with both LeetCode and system design practice.  
> I respected my physical signals and allowed myself to rest — which is just as important as pushing through.  
> Found a **great new combo habit** (study + stepper) that can boost both my health and study flow going forward.
