## ✅ What I Studied

### 🔢 LeetCode – Problem #1004: Max Consecutive Ones III
**Time Spent:** 0.5 hrs (Evening)

- Solved one LeetCode problem before bed to maintain daily consistency.

### 🧱 System Design – HelloInterview: Design File Storage (Dropbox Clone)
**Time Spent:** 7.25 hrs

- Deep dive into designing a Dropbox-style system.
- Practiced breaking down the problem out loud as in a real interview.
- Attempted diagrams and verbal explanations: 
  - Metadata service
  - File chunking and deduplication
  - CAP theorem trade-offs
  - Auto file syncing between devices

**Challenges:**
- Felt heavy cognitive load throughout the session.
- Struggled with where to begin each section, which caused loss of momentum.
- Frequently distracted and had to reread/watch segments multiple times.
- The "interactive" approach slowed me down more than expected — hard to keep mental flow.

## 🔄 Reflections

- System design took much longer than expected and drained my focus.
- I felt stuck in multiple parts of the Dropbox design — need a more structured, confidence-building approach.
- I’m realizing that **starting the day with system design is too mentally heavy** and hurts productivity.
- Solving a LeetCode problem at the end of the day felt like a better way to close the loop.

## 🧠 Strategy Adjustment (Going Forward)

**New Daily Structure:**
1. ✅ **Start with LeetCode** (confidence + quick win)
2. 🧠 **Midday: System Design** (heavier focus work)
3. 🔁 **Evening: End with LeetCode** (reinforcement or easier problem)

This sequence should help manage energy levels and reduce resistance throughout the day.
