**Total:** 1 + 0.75 + 2 + 1.75 + 2.75 + 0.5 = **8.75 hrs**

### Focus
Spent most of the time on **LeetCode** and ~1 hour on **System Design**.

### 📘 LeetCode

**New Problem**
- [1193. Monthly Transactions I](https://leetcode.com/problems/monthly-transactions-i/)

**Review from Yesterday**
- 303. Range Sum Query - Immutable  
- 1353. Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended  
- 933. Number of Recent Calls  
- 784. Letter Case Permutation  
- 29. Divide Two Integers

### 🔁 Top 200 Review Strategy
- Goal: check if I can recall **approach, code flow, time/space complexity**.  
- If I can’t recall → mark for later review.  
- If I want to re-learn → take time to type it out.  
- Note down struggles/unclear parts.

### ✅ 27 Questions Covered
LC: 1249, 408, 680, 314, 215, 199, 543, 339, 1650, 227, 528, 560, 236, 1762, 56, 50, 162, 1, 347, 88, 125, 71, 1091, 129, 138, 31, 121

- 314. Binary Tree Vertical Order Traversal → BFS queue (node, col), `col_table` dict  
- 528. Random Pick with Weight → prefix sum + `randint` + `bisect_left`. Need dry run.  
- 560. Subarray Sum Equals K → prefix sum + hashmap. Thought of prefix sum but got stuck on usage.  
- 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree → forgot base case `if not root or root == p or root == q: return root`.  
- 50. Pow(x, n) → bitwise exponentiation, resolved but needs more review.  
- 1. Two Sum → confused with 3Sum at first.  
- 347. Top K Frequent Elements → knew Counter + heap, but forgot (count, num) tuple trick.  
- 1091. Shortest Path in Binary Matrix → decided to actually type up solution.  
- 138. Copy List with Random Pointer → remembered the two-pass structure: copy nodes, then connect.  
- 31. Next Permutation → recalled the idea but execution details were wrong. Need more practice.

### 📊 Time Complexity Review
- **Factorial** → permutations / arrangements (all orderings).  
- **Exponential (2^n)** → subsets / partitioning (binary keep/cut per position).  
- **Polynomial (n², n³, …)** → path problems (e.g., Path Sum II = O(n²), up to n paths of length n).

### 🛠 System Design
- Worked on system design templates.  
- Reviewed **data flow concepts**: fan-out, fan-in, etc.
