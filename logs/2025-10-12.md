## ðŸªž Notes
Started using **AI-generated Anki cards** for the GFG Top 10 Algorithms.  
Originally intended to create one per page, but the AI broke them into multiple smaller cards â€” making review **faster, easier, and more engaging**.  
This chunk-based learning method is improving comprehension and retention while keeping the process enjoyable.
