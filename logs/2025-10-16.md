## 🪞 Notes
Had a breakthrough in **behavioral interview preparation** today.  
I used AI to generate tailored anki cards based on the STAR stories I've written, my project descriptions, the resume, and the company values. It generated quality cards and I genuinely somewhat enjoyed going through these cards.
