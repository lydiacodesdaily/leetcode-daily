## üß† Key Takeaways

- üîç Learned why **max-heaps** are used in k-closest problems and how to build prefix sums for **weighted random pick**.
- üßµ Practiced **doubly linked list pointer manipulation** for LRU Cache (`_add`, `_remove`, `_move_to_head`).
- ‚úÖ Deepened understanding of **recursive return logic** in binary tree problems (e.g., `LCA`, `sum root-to-leaf`).
- ü§Ø Took time to fully internalize tricky problems like **Next Permutation** using detailed dry runs and in-line walkthroughs.
- üõ†Ô∏è Debugged edge cases in `mergeKLists` and learned to guard against `NoneType` in heap operations.
