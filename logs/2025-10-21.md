## ðŸªž Notes
The Capital One interviews were a bit different from what I had prepared for overall, but the experience was truly invaluable.
My main goal was to stay composed and confident, and I accomplished that â€” even after facing unexpected challenges in the system design round. I realized that the interviewerâ€™s approach didnâ€™t follow the structured framework I had studied from Hello Interview or Grokking and there were 5 complex requirements that I had to implement, which threw me off. After that round didnâ€™t go as well as I hoped, I briefly felt like giving up â€” but I regained focus and pushed through the remaining interviews with calm determination.

Iâ€™m proud that I didnâ€™t let my nerves show this time. Regardless of the outcome, this was a significant step forward in my growth. I know Iâ€™ll perform even better in the next one.
