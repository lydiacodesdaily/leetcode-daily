## 🪞 Reflection
I felt overwhelmed with the sheer amount of behavioral stories I need to come up with alongside the coding and system design prep. I’ll work on these stories simultaneously while preparing for the interview. Right now, it feels like I have so little time left and so much work to do — I don’t feel ready for any of it. Part of me wants to postpone the interviews badly, but I’ve decided to push through, whether I get accepted or not.
