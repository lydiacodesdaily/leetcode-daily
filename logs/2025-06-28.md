# üóìÔ∏è Daily Log: June 28, 2025 (Saturday)

**Total Study Time:** 7.25 hours
**Material Covered:**

* 6 Meta-tagged LeetCode questions
* Focused review of **Parentheses Problems Master Guide**
* Watched videos on study techniques for improving memory and recall
* Applied recall techniques to strengthen memory of complex problems

---

## ‚úÖ Key Progress:

* Grouped similar parentheses problems together to build better memory associations:

  * LeetCode 20 - Valid Parentheses
  * LeetCode 921 - Minimum Add to Make Parentheses Valid
  * LeetCode 1249 - Minimum Remove to Make Valid Parentheses
  * LeetCode 32 - Longest Valid Parentheses
  * LeetCode 301 - Remove Invalid Parentheses
  * LeetCode 678 - Valid Parenthesis String
  * LeetCode 22 - Generate Parentheses

* Created the **Parentheses Problems Master Guide** with:

  * Problem summaries
  * Patterns
  * Core ideas
  * Memory hooks
  * Full solutions

* Grouping similar problems significantly improved problem recall and understanding.

---

## üß† Study Techniques Applied:

* Practiced **memory chunking** and **solution layout-based recall**.
* The new recall method seems promising for long-term retention but will require further testing.
* Recognized that organizing by problem type and focusing on the similiarities and the differences among these questions is helping solidify memory

## üîç LeetCode Problems Worked On:

1. **LeetCode 173 - Binary Search Tree Iterator**

   * Reviewed correct in-order traversal using a stack.
   * Corrected misunderstanding around traversal control and pointer manipulation.

2. **LeetCode 301 - Remove Invalid Parentheses**

   * Understood the importance of the `found` flag in BFS to guarantee minimal removal.

3. **LeetCode 32 - Longest Valid Parentheses**

   * Deepened understanding of stack-based window tracking.
   * Clarified how stack indexes define valid window lengths.

4. **LeetCode 20 - Valid Parentheses**

   * Reviewed the standard stack-based matching pattern.

5. **LeetCode 921 - Minimum Add to Make Parentheses Valid**

   * Practiced the greedy counting technique for unmatched parentheses.

6. **LeetCode 8 - String to Integer (atoi)**

   * Focused on correctly handling overflow using integer-safe checks.
   * Learned why floor division (`//`) is critical for pre-checks in overflow scenarios.
   * Practiced the step-by-step parsing: skip spaces ‚Üí check sign ‚Üí read digits ‚Üí clamp overflow

---

## üåü Reflections:

* Significant improvement in recall speed and accuracy by clustering problems by pattern.
* Less overwhelmed by parentheses problems thanks to structured, side-by-side comparisons.
* Study strategy videos reinforced the importance of long-term memory over cramming.
* Actively practicing layout-based recall has helped me feel more grounded when seeing problems.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Adjustments Moving Forward:

* Continue building master guides for other problem types.
* Deepen the recall system with daily, targeted Anki reviews.
* Maintain sleep discipline and limit prolonged study breaks.
* Further practice using the solution structure layout as a memory retrieval system.
