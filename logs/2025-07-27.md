## 📐 System Design (4.5 hours)
- Studied **“Design a News Aggregator”** from HelloInterview.
- Began to understand the **big picture approach** to system design.
- Practiced the full flow:
  - Gathering **functional + non-functional requirements**
  - Identifying **core entities**
  - Designing **REST APIs**
  - Sketching the **High-Level Architecture**
  - Walking through **deep dives** (e.g. data flow, storage, ranking)
- 🧠 Emotional note: I panicked for about an hour because I felt overwhelmed, but I sat through the discomfort and slowly reviewed the entire flow. It took longer than planned, but I’m proud I pushed through instead of giving up.

## 🧠 LeetCode Practice (2.5 hours)
Solved 5 questions:

1. 1091. Shortest Path in Binary Matrix 
   → Learned correct BFS logic: track path length, stop at destination, avoid just counting visited.

2. 1570. Dot Product of Two Sparse Vectors
   → Practiced object-oriented design and efficient iteration.

3. 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
   → Refreshed sliding window approach to track min price and max profit.

4. 938. Range Sum of BST
   → Clarified BST pruning logic (don't skip children unless subtree is fully out of range).

5. 346. Moving Average from Data Stream
   → Caught subtle bug with `len(self.size)` vs `len(self.queue)` and learned to handle warm-up edge case.
