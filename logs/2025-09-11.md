## ⏱️ Total Study Hours  
🕒 **7 hours**

## 🎤 Meta Interviews  
- **Behavioral Interview**  
  - Felt like the interviewer had a very specific type of “stories” in mind and I was not providing it.  
  - My career in public sector / government contracting means the stories I highlight can differ. I felt like I should have worked with a consultant to go over my stories and confirm that I have selected the most effective stories.
  - Hoping that this gap won’t cost me passing the interviews.  

- **Product Architecture Interview**  
  - Genuinely enjoyable ✨  
  - Loved **designing, brainstorming, and bouncing ideas** back and forth.  
  - Felt energizing to share my thoughts in a collaborative way.

## 📘 Study / Prep  
- Spent the remaining hours **preparing for the two interviews**.

## 🌟 Reflection  
Mixed feelings: a bit of uncertainty about whether my **background stories matched Meta’s cultural lens**, but overall proud of my preparation.  
Product architecture reminded me why I enjoy **problem solving and design thinking** — it felt natural and fun.
