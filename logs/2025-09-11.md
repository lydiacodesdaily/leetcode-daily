## ⏱️ Total Study Hours  
🕒 **7 hours**

## 🎤 Meta Interviews  
- **Behavioral Interview**  
  - Felt like the interviewer had a very specific set of “stories” he wanted to hear.  
  - My career in **public sector / government contracting** means the stories I highlight can differ from private-sector expectations.  
  - Hoping that this **context gap** won’t cost me passing the interviews.  

- **Product Architecture Interview**  
  - Genuinely enjoyable ✨  
  - Loved **designing, brainstorming, and bouncing ideas** back and forth.  
  - Felt energizing to share my thoughts in a collaborative way.

## 📘 Study / Prep  
- Spent the remaining hours **preparing for the two interviews**.  

---

## 🌟 Reflection  
Mixed feelings: a bit of uncertainty about whether my **background stories matched Meta’s cultural lens**, but overall proud of my preparation.  
Product architecture reminded me why I enjoy **problem solving and design thinking** — it felt natural and fun.
