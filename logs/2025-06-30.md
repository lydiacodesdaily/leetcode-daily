# üóìÔ∏è Daily Log ‚Äì June 30, 2025 (Monday)

**Total Study Time:**  8.25 hours

**Material Covered:**  
- 8 Meta-tagged LeetCode questions  
- Watched videos on memorization techniques and visualizations

## Summary:
Two days until the Meta interview!

A TikTok recruiter reached out to me this morning about their core algorithm teams, so I spent some time updating my resume and sending it over to her. Despite the detour, I managed to invest a good chunk of focused study time for the upcoming Meta interview.

Today, I experimented with **memorization techniques using simplifications and visualizations.**  
Last night, I applied a visual memory method to a problem I already knew but struggled to code from memory. I simplified it down to a **core one-liner trigger** to help me recall the structure. When I tried it this afternoon, I was able to **fully write up the solution from scratch.**

I created memory technique images and recall stories in **OneNote.**  
It‚Äôs been surprisingly fun creating these visualizations ‚Äî I genuinely enjoyed it.

I continued reviewing the **most frequently asked Meta LeetCode questions from the past three months.**  
Initially, I panicked because I couldn‚Äôt remember how to solve some of them. Others I knew conceptually but couldn‚Äôt get the implementation right ‚Äî everything felt jumbled.

Even though I‚Äôm clearly **not fully ready for the upcoming interview,** I‚Äôll give it my best. I‚Äôm excited that I will be much more prepared for the next one using this new visualization approach.

## LeetCode Problems Studied:

### ‚úÖ Question 1: LeetCode 680 - Valid Palindrome II
- **Breakthrough:** Memorizing the one-liner helped me fully recall the solution.
- **Key Takeaway:** Even though I conceptually knew how to solve it, I initially struggled to code it. After applying the one-liner visualization, I now feel solid on this question.

---

### ‚úÖ Question 2: LeetCode 543 - Diameter of Binary Tree
- Continued practice and solidified recall.

---

### ‚úÖ Question 3: LeetCode 1249 - Minimum Remove to Make Valid Parentheses
- **Breakthrough:** Created a memory visualization on OneNote ‚Üí Immediate recall success.
- **Caveat:** Learned `.update()` is used to merge list into set.

---

### ‚úÖ Question 4: LeetCode 314 - Binary Tree Vertical Order Traversal
- Created visual memory story and diagram.
- Recalled successfully after time-spaced review.

---

### ‚úÖ Question 5: LeetCode 215 - Kth Largest Element in an Array
- **Fully mastered.** Feels easy now. Got 100% correct.

---

### ‚úÖ Question 6: LeetCode 227 - Basic Calculator II
- **Breakthrough:** The key mistake I kept making was thinking I needed to process the number using the current sign.  
- Learned that I must **process the number using the previous sign** when I hit the current sign.
- Created a one-liner recall:  
  `"When I hit a sign ‚Üí process using the previous sign ‚Üí reset num ‚Üí update sign."`
- The visual story of **filing receipts in a binder** really helped me lock in the recall.

---

### ‚úÖ Question 7: LeetCode 1650 - Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree III
- Continued reinforcement and review.

---

### ‚úÖ Question 8: LeetCode 528 - Random Pick with Weight
- **Struggled previously:** I looked at this problem 3 times over 15 days and kept forgetting it.
- **Breakthrough:** Spent 30 minutes visualizing the problem today ‚Üí I can now perfectly recall it.
- **Reflection:** I‚Äôm amazed by how well this visualization method works for me.

---

## Reflections:
- I‚Äôm genuinely sad that I won‚Äôt have enough time to apply this memory technique to all 75 Meta-tagged LeetCode questions before this interview.
- However, I‚Äôm excited to continue refining this process and feel confident that I will be much better prepared for the next one.
