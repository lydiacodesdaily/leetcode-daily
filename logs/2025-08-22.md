### 📚 Review Top Meta-Tagged (28–40/200)

**28–30/200**
- **1570. Dot Product of Two Sparse Vectors** — recall gist, but need to type up later to confirm details.  
- **146. LRU Cache** *** — overwhelming; will revisit with a calm mind.  
- **938. Range Sum of BST** — typed up; mostly correct but forgot to return `dfs()`.  
- **346. Moving Average from Data Stream** — typed up; initial version used `sum()` = O(n). Fixed by maintaining a running sum and subtracting popped values.  
- **34. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array** — thought I understood, but realized I was missing crucial details (tracking result, handling ±1 adjustments to `mid`).

**40/200**
- **1004. Max Consecutive Ones III** *  
- **921. Minimum Add to Make Parentheses Valid** — missed counting insertions (need two counters: `open_count` and `insertions`).  
- **670. Maximum Swap** *** — correct idea: scan left→right, check digits from rightmost larger, swap once.  
- **133. Clone Graph** * — structure was correct; missed a few implementation details.  
- **986. Interval List Intersections** *** — needed to reason why overlap = `[max(start), min(end)]` and why we discard the smaller end interval.

### 🔄 Review Marked Qs from Yesterday (out of 27)

1. **314. Binary Tree Vertical Order Traversal** — typed up correctly; forgot to check root exists.  
2. **528. Random Pick with Weight** — recalled and solved.  
3. **560. Subarray Sum Equals K** *** — knew prefix sum + hash, but struggled. Spent time deeply understanding why `count += freq[prefix_sum - k]`. Now clearer: multiple earlier prefix sums → multiple subarrays.  
4. **236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree** — recalled and solved.  
5. **50. Pow(x, n)** *** — knew it was bitwise fast power; reviewed loop mantra:  
   - If bit set → multiply result.  
   - Square base.  
   - Shift power.  
   Needed review to implement correctly.  
6. **1. Two Sum** — solved.  
7. **347. Top K Frequent Elements** — solved.  
8. **1091. Shortest Path in Binary Matrix** ** — got structure, but missed:  
   - Including diagonals in directions.  
   - Initial distance = 1, not 0.  
   - Checking destination inside BFS loop.  
   - Valid boundary + `grid[r][c] == 0` check (I only checked visited).  
9. **138. Copy List with Random Pointer** — solved.  
10. **31. Next Permutation** — mostly correct; missed `if i >= 0:` condition. Important when no pivot exists (descending order).

## 🏗️ System Design

- Compiled a **master table** of:  
  - Functional requirements  
  - Non-functional requirements  
  - Estimations  
  - Key components  
  - Bottlenecks & scaling  
  - Critical tradeoffs  
  - Deep-dive focus areas  
  - *What not to build* for critical systems  

This will serve as a structured reference for product architecture interviews.

## 📝 Reflection

- Stayed up until 4AM stressed about the **ceiling fix** scheduled for the morning.  
- Insurance claims remain unresolved; the other company isn’t responding.  
- Felt frustrated: “I could study better if not stressed.”  
- Reframed it: stress is part of life — if not this, it would be something else. Despite stress, still put in **solid hours**.  
- When unable to sleep, switched to **admin tasks** (not counted toward study time) and did system design review.
