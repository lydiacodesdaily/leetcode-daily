### ✅ LeetCode Problems Studied

1. **[200. Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)**
   - DFS grid traversal (burn the island)
   - Key takeaway: mutate `'1' → '0'` to mark visited; loop continues to find new unvisited land.
   - 🧠 Memory Hook: "If it's land → it's a new island → DFS and sink it."

2. **[8. String to Integer (atoi)](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-to-integer-atoi/)**
   - Clarified that parsing **must stop at the first invalid character** after digits begin.
   - Example: `"0-1"` → stops at `0`, ignores `-1`, returns `0`
   - Considered whether simpler overflow logic (`curr > MAX_INT`) is acceptable in interviews — ✅ as long as you're aware.

3. **[426. Convert BST to Sorted Doubly Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-binary-search-tree-to-sorted-doubly-linked-list/)**
   - In-order traversal + pointer wiring (`last.right = curr`, `curr.left = last`)
   - After traversal, connect head ↔ tail to make it circular.
   - 🧠 Memory Hook: link during in-order, finalize with circular wrap

4. **[824. Goat Latin](https://leetcode.com/problems/goat-latin/)**
   - Reviewed why mutating `word` in a loop like `for i, word in enumerate(words)` doesn't update the original list — need to reassign to `words[i]`.

5. **[398. Random Pick Index](https://leetcode.com/problems/random-pick-index/)**
   - Used `defaultdict` to map values → indices; used `random.choice()`
   - Interview tip: prefer `.discard()` over `.remove()` in sliding window for safety

6. **[9. Palindrome Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/)**
   - Reviewed string-based and two-pointer approaches
   - Learned optimal way: **reverse half the number** and compare → O(log n), O(1)
   - 🧠 Why reverse half? Avoids full reversal and handles odd/even cases easily.

7. **[528. Random Pick with Weight](https://leetcode.com/problems/random-pick-with-weight/)**
   - 🎯 “The higher the weight, the higher the chance it gets picked” — intuitive anchor
   - Built `prefix sum` array, used `random.randint(1, total)` and `bisect_left`
   - Explored how to replace `bisect_left()` with custom binary search
   - 🧠 Memory Hook: prefix maps weights to ranges, random point lands in a segment

### 📝 Reflection
- Took a slower start in the morning/afternoon to refresh and recharge.
- Strong focus and deep conceptual reinforcement in the evening.
- Clarified several confusing patterns around binary search, prefix sums, mutation in loops, and integer parsing edge cases.
- Felt more confident especially with problems that initially felt overwhelming (e.g., 528).
