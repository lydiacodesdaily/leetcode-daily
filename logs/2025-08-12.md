`0.5 + 2 + 1 + 1.75 + 1.5`

## 🐿️ Personal Notes
- Woke up around **6 AM** to the noise of wildlife in the attic.  
- This feels like déjà vu — just dealt with a roof water damage issue not too long ago.  
- Sleep was cut short, so I expected a rough day.  
- Spent time calling **13 different companies** to arrange inspections for today and tomorrow.  
- This disruption put me behind on my study plan.

## 💻 LeetCode Practice — 3.25 hrs
`1.75 + 1.5`

1. **1249. Minimum Remove to Make Valid Parentheses** — Stack-based cleanup approach  
2. **408. Valid Word Abbreviation** — Fixed bounds check logic (`>=` vs `>` rules for different cases)  
3. **680. Valid Palindrome II** — Two-pointer check allowing one removal  
4. **215. Kth Largest Element in an Array** — Heap/Quickselect  
5. **543. Diameter of Binary Tree** — DFS with height tracking  
6. **1650. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree III** — Parent pointer + two-pointer meeting  
7. **314. Binary Tree Vertical Order Traversal** — BFS with column indexing

## 📌 Reflection
- Interview/resume work took a large portion of the day.  
- The **Valid Word Abbreviation** problem helped clarify the exact rules for `>=` vs `>` in bounds checking:
  - After skipping with numbers → check `j > len(word)`  
  - Before matching a char → check `j >= len(word)`  
- Behind on my study schedule due to the attic situation, but still managed to complete 7 problems despite fatigue.
