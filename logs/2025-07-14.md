**9.75 hours**

## 🧩 Focus Areas
- Solved 5 new LeetCode problems
- Strengthened Linked List understanding

## ✅ Problems Covered
- LeetCode 1209 – Remove All Adjacent Duplicates in String II  
- LeetCode 1011 – Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days

## 🧠 Study Notes
- Struggled with **Linked List pointer logic**, especially:
  - Where to point `next`, `prev`, `curr` based on different questions
  - Correct order of pointer reassignment to avoid breaking the chain
- Compiled a detailed **Linked List Patterns Guide** to clarify pointer strategies
- Generated **fill-in-the-blank questions using ChatGPT** on Linked List patterns for **active recall practice**

## 🧘 Reflections
- Pointer manipulation in Linked Lists requires careful step-by-step execution — draw diagrams to visualize
- Active recall (especially fill-in-the-blank) helps cement pattern understanding
- Found a study group through virtual body doubling. Having them around helps me stay on track, pick up new study techniques, and stay motivated through shared momentum
