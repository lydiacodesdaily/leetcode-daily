# ðŸ“… Daily Log - June 25, 2025 (Wednesday)

**Total Study Time:** 4 hours

**Material Covered:**  
- 10 Meta-tagged LeetCode Anki flashcards  
- Interview and study strategies  
- Problem-specific memory hooks and deep dives:
  - Moving Average from Data Stream
  - Range Sum of BST
  - Next Permutation
  - Minimum Add to Make Parentheses Valid
  - Max Consecutive Ones III
  - Interval List Intersections
  - All Nodes Distance K in Binary Tree
  - Kth Missing Positive Number
  - Valid Number
  - Diagonal Traverse

---

## âœ… Key Accomplishments:
- Developed a new LeetCode study workflow:
  - Review Anki flashcards until I feel confident enough to write out the solution.
  - If incorrect, log the miss in Notion and mark the mistake in red for focused review.
- Refined memory hooks and recall strategies:
  - Valid Number memory hook fully solidified and now feels fast to recall.
  - Strengthened understanding of why the answer to LeetCode 1539 Kth Missing Positive Number is `left + k`.
- Deepened understanding of:
  - How to correctly prune BSTs using `if root.val < low` and `if root.val > high`.
  - Diagonal traversal patterns using sum of indices.
- Gained insights from dry runs and applied error corrections:
  - Max Consecutive Ones III â†’ caught missteps in variable tracking during dry runs.
  - Interval List Intersections â†’ remembered the comparison to shift pointers.

## ðŸ’­ Reflections:
- Slept earlier and felt better than the day before, but adjusting my biorythm slightly impacted my energy.
- I took a planned 30-minute break that unintentionally became almost 2 hours. Iâ€™ve decided to:
  - Limit breaks to **maximum 15 minutes.**
  - Focus on short restorative tasks between study blocks.
  - Completely avoid using my iPad until the evening or until the next morningâ€™s study block is done.
- I spent an additional 1.5 hours on admin work and submitting applications, which reduced focused study time.
- After reviewing my calendar, I was disappointed to realize that **actual pure study time was only 4 hours.**

## ðŸŽ¯ Focus for Tomorrow:
- Minimum target: **7 hours of focused studying.**
- Continue building the system of error tracking and fast recall.
- Prioritize:
  - Weak spots like BST pruning logic and binary search variants.
  - More dry runs to catch logic errors in sliding window and interval problems.
