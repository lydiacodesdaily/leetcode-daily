## ✅ Study Reflection:

Now that I’m managing my sleep better and increasing my overall productivity, I’m tackling another issue:
I often don’t feel grounded in the **morning and early afternoon**, which has been hurting my productivity.

To improve my focus, I decided to **move my desk and set up a "dark cave" environment** — a dark room with just a lamp.
🌟 After doing so, I felt much more grounded and was able to focus significantly better throughout the day.

## 🔁 LeetCode Questions Covered:

### 1. **8. String to Integer (atoi)**

* ✅ Tested myself using the **new memory technique**.
* 🎉 Successfully recalled the solution exactly the next day → **huge win.**

### 2. **394. Decode String**

* Used the **associative story technique** (suitcase packing story) → helped recall the stack structure quickly.

### 3. **1094. Car Pooling**

* Created a **bus ride story** to remember the difference array and prefix sum approach.
* Memorized the process and was able to recall it fast.

### 4. **1216. Valid Palindrome III**

* Worked on chunking the DP process to better organize the steps mentally.

### 5. **543. Diameter of Binary Tree**

* Used **drone road measurement story** → helped anchor the postorder DFS pattern.

### 6. **Kth Largest Element in an Array**

* Practiced and reinforced the heap process and core memory hook.

### 7. **408. Valid Word Abbreviation**

* Reviewed previous solution.
* Key takeaway: **index protection and two-pointer synchronization**.

### 8. **680. Valid Palindrome II**

* Conceptually understood the solution but always forgot the key implementation detail.
* 🔑 Key to memorize:

  ```text
  return is_palindrome(left + 1, right) or is_palindrome(left, right - 1)
  ```
* Repetition and memory hook will help lock this down.

## 🌟 Key Progress:

* Memory techniques are starting to stick.
* Feeling much more confident in recalling some of the tough problems using **associative stories and memory hooks.**
* Improved my focus dramatically with the **dark cave setup.**
