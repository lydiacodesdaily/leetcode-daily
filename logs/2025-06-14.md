# üóìÔ∏è June 14, 2025

**Total Study Time:** ~5.5 hours

Today was emotionally tough. I met up with a friend for lunch, and although the lunch itself was fine, I ended up spiraling afterward ‚Äî questioning whether I‚Äôm on the right path, if I‚Äôm studying the right way, or if I need to do something drastically different. I lost most of the afternoon to self-doubt and distraction. It was hard to reset, but I finally managed to regain focus around 9 PM and resumed studying.

## üß† Topics Covered

### ‚úÖ LeetCode Problems Solved:

- [Merge k Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/)
  - Learned how Python handles min-heaps with tuples.
  - **Key Insight:** Python compares tuples lexicographically ‚Äî so the structure `(val, list_index, node)` allows node comparison without errors. `list_index` is used to avoid TypeErrors when node values are the same.

- [Clone Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/)
  - Practiced graph traversal and cloning with DFS and a visited hashmap.

- [Longest Palindromic Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/)
  - Reviewed expand-around-center strategy.
  - Clarified why `start = i - (max_len - 1) // 2` uses `max_len - 1`, but `end = i + max_len // 2` doesn't.

- [Merge Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/)
  - Practiced sorting and merging logic.

- [Diameter of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/)
  - DFS recursion; updated global max using nonlocal during subtree traversal.

- [Pow(x, n)](https://leetcode.com/problems/powx-n/submissions/1664246218/)
  - Implemented binary exponentiation for O(log n) time.

- [Minimum Remove to Make Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-remove-to-make-valid-parentheses/)
  - Used stack to track invalid parentheses and reconstructed valid string.

- [Valid Word Abbreviation](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-word-abbreviation/)
  - Handled string parsing with two pointers.
  - Fixed subtle bugs like checking `'0'` as a string and placing return outside the loop.

## üí¨ Reflection
Although I struggled to stay focused during the afternoon, I‚Äôm proud I bounced back in the evening. This reminded me how external conversations can deeply affect my focus ‚Äî especially when I‚Äôm in an emotionally vulnerable or uncertain state. I‚Äôll be more mindful of this moving forward and protect my post-social time better.
