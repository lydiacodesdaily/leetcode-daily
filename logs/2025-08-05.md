## 🧠 LeetCode Practice (4.75 hrs)
Focused on both classic patterns and edge-case-heavy problems:

### ✅ Problems Covered:
1. **78. Subsets**  
   - Backtracking with include/exclude logic  
   - Recognized `O(n × 2ⁿ)` time/space  
   - Practiced dry run and recursive tree structure

2. **1768. Merge Strings Alternately**

3. **53. Maximum Subarray**  
   - Applied Kadane’s Algorithm (dynamic sliding window)  
   - Realized it’s a Fibonacci-type recurrence

4. **75. Sort Colors**  
   - Compared multiple solutions  
   - Implemented Dutch National Flag algorithm (optimal, single pass, O(1) space)

5. **536. Construct Binary Tree from String**  
   - Reviewed parsing logic and recursive construction  
   - Identified edge cases: empty, left-only, right-only, nested, negative  
   - Discussed the use of `lower - 1` and `upper + 1` virtual bounds

6. **163. Missing Ranges**  
   - Recognized as range-gap problem, not stack-based  
   - Used virtual bounds and tracked all key edge cases:
     - empty input, only one missing, full missing, lower == upper, negatives

7. **348. Design Tic-Tac-Toe**

8. **1047. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String**

9. **70. Climbing Stairs**  
   - Solved with bottom-up Fibonacci (O(1) space)  
   - Understood `ways(n) = F(n+1)` transformation

10. **958. Check Completeness of a Binary Tree**

## 🧘 Wellness & Reflection
- Slept well and woke up earlier than usual
- Helped a friend in emotional distress (~30–40 minutes in the morning)
- Still managed to stay focused and got a lot done
