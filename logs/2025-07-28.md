## 📐 System Design – 5.5 hours  
**HelloInterview – Design Bit.ly (URL Shortener)**

### 🔍 Key Concepts Reviewed:
- Clarified the difference between **functional vs. non-functional requirements**
  - ✅ Ensuring **uniqueness** is a **functional** requirement.
- Analyzed why **Bit.ly uses 302 redirects** instead of 301:
  - Flexibility for URL mapping
  - Click tracking
  - Control over cache behavior
- Learned **Base62 encoding** and **global counter strategy**:
  - Base62 = [0–9, a–z, A–Z] → compact ID space
  - Redis for atomic, high-speed **global counter**
  - Confirmed Base62(125) = `"21"`
- Explored handling **20K redirects/sec**:
  - Tiered caching: **CDN + Redis**
  - Horizontally scale Read Service (stateless)
  - Pre-warm cache for hot links, rate-limit at gateway
- Sketched **high-level architecture**:
  - API Gateway → Write Service & Read Service
  - Redis for fast access, RDBMS for persistence
  - CDN for global low-latency traffic

### 🪞 Reflections:
- I'm getting more comfortable, but not quite “ready” yet.
- The **interactive version** took much longer than expected, but it was actually **fun**, and that made a big difference in helping me push through without feeling overwhelmed.

## 🧠 LeetCode – 4 hours  
Solved 5 Questions:

1. [146. LRU Cache](https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/)  
   → Took time to deeply understand the **doubly linked list + hashmap version**  
   → Decided to stick with this version only to reduce confusion

2. [791. Custom Sort String](https://leetcode.com/problems/custom-sort-string/)  
   → Reinforced hashmap + frequency usage for custom ordering

3. [31. Next Permutation](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-permutation/)  
   → Finally “clicked” after breaking it down with:
   - visual pattern
   - 3-step memory hook: *find dip → swap → reverse suffix*

4. [973. K Closest Points to Origin](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/)  
   → Refreshed min-heap / sorting approaches

5. [670. Maximum Swap](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-swap/)  
   → Learned to visualize with digit positions and greedy right-swap using a **last index map**

### 🪄 Reflection:
- I didn’t solve as *many* questions as planned, but I tackled two that have always felt slippery: **LRU Cache** and **Next Permutation**.
- I asked ChatGPT to break them down with **visual hooks, memory tricks, and dry-runable patterns** — and it worked.
- It was a **magical moment** when I could just type the solution out from memory. I’m not sure if I’ll still recall them in a few days, but it finally felt *possible*.

## ✅ Summary:
- 9.5 hours of focused effort, including deep dives into hard topics.
- Making meaningful progress by building *comfort with complexity*, not just speed.
- Wins today came from **embracing fun + structure**, not perfection.
