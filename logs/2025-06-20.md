# ðŸ“… Daily Log - June 20, 2025 (Friday)

**Total Study Time:** 9 hours  
**Material Covered:**  
- Updated **75 Meta-tagged LeetCode Anki flashcards**:
  - Added: Patterns, Core Ideas, Memory Hooks, Time and Space Complexities, and Code Implementations.
- Studied **20 LeetCode Anki flashcards**.

---

## âœ… Key Accomplishments:
- Built a more efficient LeetCode Anki system:
  - Separated **Core Idea** (conceptual understanding) and **Memory Hook** (fast recall keys).
  - Improved flashcard structure to support rapid review and deep understanding.
- Studied:
  - Difference between **excluding result space vs. including result space** when calculating space complexity.
- Refined approach:
  - Decided to **exclude result space** from space complexity unless the interview specifically asks to include it.
  - Confirmed that some problems (e.g. Add Two Numbers) inherently include result space in complexity analysis.
- Focused:
  - How to categorize **top-k problems**: understood when to classify them under Hash Map vs. Heap.
  - Focused on **memory hooks that emphasize what makes each problem unique**, rather than generic patterns.
  - Preferred to use sliding window with **set-based solutions** if they align with established patterns, even when other solutions exist.

---

## ðŸ’­ Reflections:
- Making great progress in systematizing and solidifying LeetCode problem recall.
- The **structured Anki format** now feels aligned with long-term retention.
- Feeling more confident in tracking time and space complexities correctly across problems.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Focus for Tomorrow:
- Continue updating remaining Anki flashcards with new structure.
- Focus on rapid pattern recognition and weak spots during review.
- Keep reinforcing problem-specific memory hooks to reduce recall errors.
