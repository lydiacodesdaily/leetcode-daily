# 📅 Daily Log — July 16, 2025 (Wednesday)

**🕒 Total Study Time:** 7.2 hours  
Breakdown: `.45 + 2.5 + 1.75 + 2.5 = 7.2 hrs`

## ✅ Material Covered:

- [x] **Leetcode 1060 - Missing Element in Sorted Array**
  - Practiced how to calculate the number of missing elements at a given index using:
    ```python
    missing = nums[idx] - nums[0] - idx
    ```
  - Compared with LC 1539 and discussed how the two differ in assumptions and implementation.
  - Clarified binary search return logic:
    - `return nums[left - 1] + (k - missing(left - 1))`
    - Versus: `return nums[0] + k + right` (alternative version)
  - Final decision: stick with the first (more intuitive) version for interviews.

- [x] **Leetcode 1539 - Kth Missing Positive Number**
  - Reviewed optimal binary search approach and clarified key formula:  
    `missing = arr[mid] - (mid + 1)`  
  - Walked through why missing can never be negative (array starts at 1, is strictly increasing).

- [x] **Leetcode 1209 - Remove All Adjacent Duplicates in String II**
  - Used a stack of `[char, count]` for grouping.
  - Clarified why we use a **list** instead of a tuple:  
    → to **mutate the count** in-place: `stack[-1][1] += 1`
  - Did a dry run on input `"deeedbbcccbdaa"` to solidify understanding of stack behavior.

- [x] **Leetcode 1047 - Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String**
  - Practiced the simpler version of the problem using a single-char stack.

- [x] **Leetcode 7 - Reverse Integer**
  - Focused on parsing, reversing digits, and handling 32-bit overflow.
  - Used modulo and integer division to reverse digit-by-digit.
  - Reviewed INT_MIN and INT_MAX handling.

## 🔁 Reflections:

- I didn’t write the log down right after studying, and some details got hazy.  
  I’ll try to log notes shortly after sessions moving forward so I don’t forget!
- Binary search problems with a `missing()` helper function feel harder to internalize,  
  but repeated dry runs are helping.
- Feeling a bit more confident with stack-based string manipulation problems.
