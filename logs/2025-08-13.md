### 📝 Daily Summary
It was an extremely stressful day. We had a few inspections scheduled for the wildlife in the attic. One of the inspectors stepped into the attic and caused a massive hole in the ceiling, spreading fiberglass insulation everywhere. Fiberglass is hazardous to touch and inhale, and now it was all over the house.  

To make things worse, the company responsible refused to provide their liability insurance or take responsibility for fixing the damage. I spent a lot of time cleaning up fiberglass and trying to barricade the area before bed, since the company wouldn't own up to their mistake.  

Despite the chaos, I still managed to step outside to a café and the library and get 3.5 hours of focused study done.
