## 🪞 Reflection
Had difficulty focusing today, but found a helpful rhythm — alternating **5–10 minute study tasks** with short movement breaks (vacuuming, dishes, dusting) helped reset attention and improve flow.

Keeping a **fixed LeetCode study block (7:30–9 PM)** with a group has been especially effective.  
Mornings have been less productive for Anki-heavy sessions, so I shifted to doing **Anki in bed at night**, especially for SQL and system design. It’s been surprisingly enjoyable and productive.  

I’ve realized the key is to **trust my natural rhythms** — aligning study types with the time of day my brain responds best. This new structure has made studying feel smoother, with less resistance and mental friction.

**🏡 Home Automation / Misc Tasks**
- Set up **SwitchBot Hub** automatic bed riser — ❌ failed (device incompatible)  
- Set up **smart light bulb** successfully  
- Packed up **SwitchBot** for return
