## 🧠 LeetCode
- `380.` Insert Delete GetRandom O(1)  
  - ❌ `set()`: O(1) insert/remove, ❌ O(n) random  
  - ✅ `list + dict` → all O(1)  
  - 1️⃣ `list` → for `getRandom()` (index access in O(1))  
  - 2️⃣ `dict` → maps element → index (O(1))  
  - 🔄 Swap target element with last before popping to maintain O(1) removal.  

- `236.` Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree  
- `102.` Binary Tree Level Order Traversal  
- `155.` Min Stack → use two stacks (`stack`, `min_stack`)  
- `284.` Peeking Iterator  
- `2043.` Simple Bank System  
- `146.` LRU Cache  

🎯 Focused on data structure design patterns — stacks, hash maps, O(1) operations, and BFS traversal logic.
