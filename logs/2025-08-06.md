# 🗓️ Daily Log — August 6, 2025 (Wednesday)

**Total: 11.5 hours**  
- LeetCode: 2.75 + 3 + 2 = **7.75 hrs**  
- System Design: 1.75 + 2 = **3.75 hrs**

---

## ✅ Summary

🧠 Total Study Time: **11.5 hours**  
🎯 Key Achievements:
- ✅ Solved **18 Leetcode problems** — a personal best
- ✅ Built stronger intuition around **binary search on answer**, **DP**, and **intervals with min-heap**
- ✅ System Design progress: watched videos on **Design Twitter**, **FB Live Comments**, **Redis**, and **Kafka**
- ✅ Began passive **behavioral interview prep** by downloading videos for end-of-day and in-between sessions

🧭 Strategy Refinement:
- Tried to push through LC when energy dipped midday — it backfired
- Will switch to **System Design during 12–3PM block** when focus for LC tends to drop
- Let go of trying to study variations for every LC problem. Instead:
  - 🟢 Focus on mastering core **patterns**
  - 🟡 Explore **1–2 variations per pattern only** if time allows

## 🔢 Leetcode Practice

**Q1: 1060. Missing Element in Sorted Array**  
→ Binary search on missing count: `missing(i) = nums[i] - nums[0] - i`

**Q2: 2265. Count Nodes Equal to Average of Subtree**  
→ Almost correct; missed returning `(total_sum, count)`

**Q3: 235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a BST**  
→ Tried general binary tree approach. The BST-based shortcut was elegant once seen.

**Q4: 1209. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates in String II**  
→ Correct; overused `pop()`. Better to increment `stack[-1][1]` and only pop when count == k

**Q5: 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists**  
→ Structure was good, but missed some areas in detail

**Q6: 169. Majority Element**  
→ Used `Counter` instead of Boyer-Moore. Need to reinforce `candidate + count` approach.

**Q7: 394. Decode String**  
→ Partial solution. Missed stack structure: should store `(prev_str, repeat_count)`

**Q8: 1094. Car Pooling**  
→ Remembered concept: track +passengers at start, -passengers at end  
→ Was unsure how to create `[0]*1001` until recalling constraints

**Q9: 49. Group Anagrams**  
→ Mistake: used tuple of chars instead of tuple of **counts**  
→ Key fix: build `[0]*26` for counts, not a tuple of ordinals

**Q10: 116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node**  
→ Solved using both BFS and constant-space pointer method  
→ Understood the tricky part: `right.next = next.left`

**Q11: 139. Word Break**  
→ Initially overwhelmed by DP  
→ Breakthrough: `dp[i]` means the first `i` characters can be segmented into valid words

**Q12: 283. Move Zeroes**  
→ Correct ✅

**Q13: 1011. Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days**  
→ Kept thinking “round robin” at first, but this is **binary search on capacity**  
→ Important insight: `right = mid` if valid, to search for min capacity

**Q14: 7. Reverse Integer**  
→ Be careful with overflow bounds and sign handling

**Q15: 13. Roman to Integer**  
→ Correct. Key insight: if current < next, subtract

**Q16: 605. Can Place Flowers**  
→ Solved ✅

**Q17: 253. Meeting Rooms II**  
→ Tried using a stack (wrong). Heap is required to track **earliest ending meeting**

**Q18: 18. 4Sum**  
→ Tried to adapt 3Sum using a stack — incorrect  
→ Correct version: fix two pointers (`i`, `j`) and use 2-pointer from `j+1` to `end`

## 📊 Energy & Time Management Notes

🕐 **12:45–2:20PM** — slow and unproductive  
- Only got through 2 problems in 2.5 hours  
- Should’ve switched earlier to system design instead of forcing LC  
📌 **Plan:** Switch tasks as soon as I lose my focus.

---

## 🏗️ System Design

**Studied via Hello Interview and YouTube deep dives:**
- Design Twitter
- Design Facebook Live Comments
- Redis internals (bit too deep for current interview scope)
- Kafka deep dive (also beyond needed level — don’t over-focus)

📌 Going too deep in infra topics (e.g. Kafka internals) was not the best use of time  
→ Pull back and focus on **system-level tradeoffs** for interviews

---

## 🧠 Behavioral Prep

- Downloaded behavioral interview content
- Plan to passively listen during low-energy times or end-of-day
- Will likely begin structuring STAR-format stories over the weekend

---

## 🧭 Reflection

With **13 days left until Meta onsite**, I’m:
- Becoming faster and more confident with Leetcode patterns
- Still working on initial problem approach instincts
- Refactoring my study blocks to align with energy cycles
- Letting go of over-prepping variations and trusting my growing pattern knowledge

🎯 Focus remains on **mastering the top 200 Meta-tagged Leetcode problems**  
If variation questions come up in interviews, I’ll lean on my understanding of base patterns to reason through them.
