### ✅ LeetCode Problems Solved

1. **[15. 3Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/)**  
   - Two Pointers + Sorting  
   - Skipped duplicates carefully to avoid repeated triplets.

2. **[5. Longest Palindromic Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/)**  
   - Expand Around Center  
   - Key insight: use `start = i - (max_len - 1) // 2` and `end = i + max_len // 2` to properly track bounds for both even and odd-length palindromes.

3. **[3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)**  
   - Sliding Window with Set  
   - ⚠️ Use `.discard(char)` instead of `.remove(char)` in interviews to avoid `KeyError` if char is not present.

4. **[721. Accounts Merge](https://leetcode.com/problems/accounts-merge/)**  
   - Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union)  
   - Mapped `email → name`  
   - Unioned emails within each account using `union(email, first_email)`  
   - Grouped by root parents and returned `[name] + sorted(emails)`

5. **[200. Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)**  
   - Grid DFS: “Burn the island” pattern  
   - For each cell in grid, if `'1'`, count += 1 and DFS to mark all connected land as `'0'`.  
   - Dry run clarified why marking `'1'` → `'0'` doesn’t prevent detecting new islands later.

### 📝 Notes
- Had to help someone today, so study time was a bit less than planned.
- Still solid progress with a strong mix of patterns: Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Union-Find, DFS, and Center Expansion.
