## ✍️ Reflection
I think I finally found a **groove** for doing reviews effectively.  

In the past, reviews felt like they took forever and I couldn’t get through them. Now I set a **time limit** and tell myself it’s okay **not to recall everything perfectly** or even any. This change in mindset made it much easier to keep momentum and revisit problems without overthinking.
