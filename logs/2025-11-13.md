## 🧠 LeetCode (Review + Pseudocode)

### Graph / BFS-DFS / Topological Sort
- `621.` Task Scheduler ***  
- `207.` Course Schedule  
- `200.` Number of Islands  

### BFS Grid & Stack-Based Parsing
- `994.` Rotting Oranges  
- `227.` Basic Calculator II  
- `150.` Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation  

### Fully Coded Today — With Notes
- `994.` Rotting Oranges  
  - Did well on BFS structure  
  - **Missed:** Handling of *fresh count* — remembered to add `fresh`, but forgot to *use it in the BFS termination condition*  
- `150.` Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation  
  - Key reminder: **`.isdigit()` does NOT handle negative numbers**  
  - Need custom check (e.g. `s.lstrip('-').isdigit()` or try/except)

🎯 Focused heavily on BFS templates, stack-based evaluation, and reinforcing tricky implementation details.
