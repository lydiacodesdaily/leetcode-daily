## 🧠 Reflection  

After reviewing so many LeetCode problems, I can now **summarize each solution in a few words**.  
- Example: *103 → BFS, loop level length, alternate reverse*  

With Meta onsite interviews in **two days**, I’m **surprisingly calm**.  
- I know I’ll never feel 100% ready, but I’m proud of the work I’ve put in.  
- Letting go of the pressure of *“I must succeed no matter what”* actually gave me peace.  

Friends worried I was “giving up,” but I don’t see it that way.  
- I’m **content** knowing I gave my best.  
- A few months ago, I was scared and shaky in my first Meta interview, even rescinded my OpenAI interview.  
- Now, whatever happens, I’m happy about:  
  - Expanding my knowledge  
  - Learning productivity techniques  
  - Growing self-awareness  
  - Building connections through virtual study groups — people I never met in person, yet shared hours daily with, creating bonds & memories  
  - Feeling the accomplishment of consistent, deep focus

## 🔄 What I’d Do Differently  
- Spent **too long typing notes + spaced repetition** → ~70 Qs took weeks  
- Rushed through the next 130 Qs in a few days, only testing recall  
- Next time: **prioritize recall first**, then type things up only once I can fully recall the solution
