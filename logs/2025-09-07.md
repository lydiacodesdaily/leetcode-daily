## 💡 Reflections
- After reviewing many questions, I can now **summarize each solution in a few words.**  
  - Example: *103. Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal → BFS, loop level length, alternate reverse*  

- My **Meta onsite interviews are in two days.**  
  - Surprisingly, I no longer feel nervous.  
  - I may never feel fully ready, but I’ve accepted that I’ve done my best.  
  - Letting go of the pressure to “achieve at all costs” gave me peace.  
  - Friends told me not to give up — but this isn’t giving up, it’s contentment.  

- Compared to months ago:  
  - I was shaky and scared during my first Meta interview.  
  - I even rescinded my OpenAI interview after Meta’s initial round.  
  - Now, I’m happy with my growth, new study techniques, and productivity.  

- I also made good **virtual study group friends** — seeing them almost daily created great memories.

## 🙏 Gratitude
- Happy I could **focus for hours and feel accomplished** at the end of the day.  
- No regrets, regardless of interview outcome.

## 🔄 What I Wish I Did Differently
- Spent **too much time typing everything out** and doing spaced repetition.  
- Took weeks just to cover ~70 questions.  
- Rushed through the remaining ~130 by checking solutions instead of full recall.  
- Next time:  
  - Do spaced repetition **based on recall first**.  
  - Type up solutions **after** I can fully recall them.
