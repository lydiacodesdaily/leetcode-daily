## ✅ LeetCode Practice: Linked List Pattern

**Problems Solved:**  
- [206. Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)  
- [92. Reverse Linked List II](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list-ii/)  
- [141. Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)  
- [328. Odd Even Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/odd-even-linked-list/)  
- [708. Insert into a Sorted Circular Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-into-a-sorted-circular-linked-list/)

**Additional Practice:**  
- Completed fill-in-the-blank quiz created with ChatGPT on **Linked List pointer patterns**  
- Focused heavily on pointer reassignments and dry running each pointer step  
- Practiced identifying when to use dummy nodes and how to group the 4-step pointer reassignment patterns  
- Discussed why certain conditions are written in a specific way (e.g., turning point logic in 708)

**Key Struggles:**  
- Visualizing the pointer reassignment in real time during reverse operations  
- Understanding the insert condition for circular linked list (why `insertVal >= curr.val or insertVal <= curr.next.val`)  
- Differentiating when to reverse vs when to reorder (e.g., odd-even)

## 🧠 System Design Prep

**Video Watched:**  
- [JordanHasNoLife – System Design Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYIjJ7utdDI&t=643s&ab_channel=Jordanhasnolife)

**Progress:**  
- Watched ~80% of the video  
- Covered core concepts like database indexes,transactions, data serialization frameworks, replication, sharding, batch and steam processing 
- Content was **more technical and dry** than the first video  
- Took notes and paused frequently to research unclear parts  
- Plan to rewatch it later to reinforce concepts

## 🪞 Reflections

- Still building fluency with linked list pointer updates; making good progress thanks to repetition and guided fill-in-the-blank exercises.
- Found that actively dry running the problems and asking "why this pointer update?" helped retention.
- System Design is still intimidating — feels like poking at the edges of a huge topic. The current video was dense and a bit difficult to stay engaged with.
- Need to balance content absorption with energy — might do system design earlier in the day next time.
