## üìö Studied & Submitted:

- [Merge k Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/submissions/1665087972/)
  - ‚úÖ Practiced Python min-heap with `(val, i, node)` tuple pattern to avoid `TypeError` when comparing `ListNode` objects.

- [Merge Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/description/)
  - ‚úÖ Reviewed in-place merge using three pointers (from the end). Learned why `while p2 >= 0` is sufficient.

- [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/submissions/1665528251/)
  - ‚úÖ Simple greedy approach; tracked `min_price` while updating `max_profit`.

- [Valid Palindrome II](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome-ii/)
  - Practiced two-pointer strategy with at most one skip.
  - ‚úÖ Struggled initially with understanding when and why to try both `left+1` and `right-1` branches ‚Äî now internalized.

- [Binary Tree Vertical Order Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-vertical-order-traversal/)
  - ‚úÖ Practiced level-order BFS with column index tracking.
  - Learned to use `deque` with `(node, col)` and store values in a `col_table` dictionary.
  - Mistakenly tried `deque((root, 0))` at first ‚Äî clarified why it must be `deque([(root, 0)])`.

- [Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree III](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree-iii/submissions/)
  - ‚úÖ Implemented two-pointer method with parent pointers.
  - Dry-ran with a custom tree structure to deeply understand how pointers sync.

- [Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/)
  - ‚úÖ Fixed a subtle bug where I was returning the wrong window ‚Äî returned `s[left:right+1]` instead of using the saved `res = [l, r]`.
  - Revisited dynamic sliding window technique.

- [Basic Calculator II](https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator-ii/)
  - ‚úÖ Implemented stack-based approach for parsing and evaluating infix expressions.
  - Spent time understanding why and when to process numbers based on operator or end of string.
  - Created a dry run comment block and mnemonic (‚ÄúSNOPS‚Äù) to make logic more memorable.

- [Subarray Sum Equals K](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k/description/)
  - ‚úÖ Mastered prefix sum + hashmap approach.
  - Key idea: track `curr_sum - k` frequency in a running `prefix_counts` dictionary.

## üß† Reflections:
- Struggled briefly with understanding **why parsing logic in calculator problems doesn't come naturally** ‚Äî realized it's not intuitive because it combines parsing, math, and stack logic rarely used in day-to-day coding.
- Practicing dry runs, edge cases, and walking through variable states helped lock in several concepts.
