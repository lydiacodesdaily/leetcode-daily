## 🧠 Reflections:
- Started mixing in Union-Find (Accounts Merge) and binary tree traversal (Completeness Check), which added variety and challenge.
- Boyer-Moore voting algorithm is now more familiar after back-to-back practice with 169 and 229.
- Time Limit Exceeded on **398** made it clear that brute force isn’t scalable — need to revisit with optimized data structure (like reservoir sampling or hashmap of indices).
- Maintained solid focus across four time blocks — nearly 8 hours of study!
