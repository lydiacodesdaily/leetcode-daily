- `1.` Two Sum  
- `1797.` Design Authentication Manager  

### Hashmap / Frequency Problems
- `49.` Group Anagrams *  
- `347.` Top K Frequent Elements **  
- `560.` Subarray Sum Equals K *  

### Interval Problems
- `56.` Merge Intervals  
- `435.` Non-overlapping Intervals *  
- `452.` Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons *  

### Array / Two-Pointer / Binary Search
- `74.` Search a 2D Matrix
