## 📘 Study Focus  
- Reflected on how to improve from my **current state**.  
- Decided to **master NeetCode’s Advanced Algorithms** and work through the associated LeetCode problems for each concept.  
- Studied **Kadane’s Algorithm** 🧠 and solved **1 related LeetCode problem** ✅.

## 📩 Recruiter Update  
- Palantir recruiter reached out during my Meta onsite interviews.  
- My impression: **Palantir emphasizes real-world coding problems** more heavily than abstract algorithm puzzles.

## 🌟 Reflection  
Today was lighter but meaningful — narrowed my **next focus area** (advanced algorithms) and aligned my prep strategy with the style of interviews I expect from Palantir and possibly OpenAI.
