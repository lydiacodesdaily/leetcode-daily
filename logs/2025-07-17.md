# 📅 Daily Log — July 17, 2025 (Thursday)

**🕒 Total Study Time:** 5.5 hours  
*(Afternoon focused due to admin/bank errands in the morning)*

---

## 🧠 Topics Studied:

### 📌 System Design – Distributed Systems
- **Platform:** [Educative - Distributed Systems for Practitioners](https://www.educative.io/courses/distributed-systems-practitioners)
- **Focus Areas:**
  - Fundamental building blocks of distributed systems
  - Reviewed: basics of distributed systems, difficulties in designing DS,system models, failure detector, stateless vs stateful systems
- **Reflections:**
  - “I feel like I’m collecting puzzle pieces, but the big picture isn’t quite clear yet.”
  - Continuing to build up foundational blocks; repetition and integration will likely bring clarity.

## 💻 LeetCode Practice:
### ✅ Problem: 116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node
- **Topic:** Binary Tree BFS
- **Why This Problem?**
  - Wanted to end the day with at least one coding problem.
- **What I Practiced:**
  - Level order traversal using a queue
  - Setting `.next` pointers per level
- **Takeaway:**
  - Reinforced BFS logic and how to properly track and update sibling pointers in tree levels.

---

## 📎 Other Notes:
- Morning was spent resolving personal administrative and banking tasks.
- Still finding system design daunting, but making progress by tackling it in small, digestible chunks.
- Staying consistent with at least 1 LeetCode per day goal.

---

## 🔁 Next Steps:
- Continue watching system design videos and reading articles.
- Maintain streak of 1+ LeetCode problem/day.
