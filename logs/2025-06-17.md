## üß† Studied LeetCode Problems

1. [31. Next Permutation](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-permutation/)
   - Pattern: Greedy / Array Manipulation
   - Focused on reversing the suffix to ensure the next smallest permutation.

2. [236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/submissions/1667544028/)
   - Pattern: Binary Tree DFS / Divide and Conquer
   - Reviewed recursive logic and base case handling.

3. [528. Random Pick with Weight](https://leetcode.com/problems/random-pick-with-weight/description/)
   - Pattern: Prefix Sum + Binary Search
   - Practiced mapping cumulative weights to random indices.

4. [146. LRU Cache](https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/)
   - Pattern: Design / HashMap + Doubly Linked List
   - Practiced internal `_add()` and `_remove()` methods; reviewed node pointer order importance.

5. [295. Find Median from Data Stream](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-median-from-data-stream)
   - Pattern: Two Heaps
   - Memory Hook: "Balance two halves ‚Äî MaxHeap for left, MinHeap for right."

6. [827. Making a Large Island](https://leetcode.com/problems/making-a-large-island/)
   - Pattern: Grid DFS + Island ID Mapping
   - Covered flipping a `0` and merging neighboring islands.

7. [938. Range Sum of BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-of-bst/description/)
   - Pattern: BST Pruning + DFS
   - Skipped subtrees based on BST properties.

8. [346. Moving Average from Data Stream](https://leetcode.com/problems/moving-average-from-data-stream/)

## ‚úÖ Additional Activity

- üîÅ **Updated 7 Anki flashcards**:
  - Added `Memory Hook` and `Keywords` fields.
  - Updated templates to surface hooks before full code for better recall.
  - Cleaned up old entries and retrofitted GitHub-style summaries.

- üß© **Flashcard Review Strategy Finalized**:
  - Decided to prioritize recall flow as:  
    **Memory Hook ‚Üí Keywords ‚Üí Time/Space ‚Üí Code Dry Run**

- üõ†Ô∏è **Anki Card Template Updated**:
  - Inserted HTML formatting to include new fields like so:
    ```html
    <strong>üß† Memory Hook:</strong> {{Memory Hook}}  
    <strong>üîë Keywords:</strong> {{Keywords}}
    ```
