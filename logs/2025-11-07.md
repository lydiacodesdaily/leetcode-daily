## 🧠 LeetCode
### Reviewed (from 11/6)
- `380.` Insert Delete GetRandom O(1)  
- `1.` Two Sum  
- `1797.` Design Authentication Manager  
- `49.` Group Anagrams  
- `347.` Top K Frequent Elements  
- `560.` Subarray Sum Equals K ***  
  - **Memory hook:** *Always set `seen[0] = 1` before the loop*  
  - This is the base-case that keeps getting forgotten — crucial for counting exact matches where prefix sum itself equals `k`.

### Fully Solved
- `56.` Merge Intervals ** *(must review again)*  
- `435.` Non-overlapping Intervals **  
- `452.` Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons **  

🎯 Heavy focus on interval problems and subarray prefix-sum patterns today. Reinforced greedy selection logic and overlap detection.

## 🏗️ System Design / SQL / Anki Review
- Created Anki cards for **quick math in System Design** (latency, throughput, storage estimates, etc.)  
- 65 System Design cards  
- 50 SQL cards  

🕒 Strengthened intuition for capacity planning and SQL optimization. The new quick-math cards should help during live system design interviews.
