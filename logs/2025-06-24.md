## 🪞 Reflection:
I struggled to focus all morning and kept beating myself up for not being productive, especially since the interview got postponed.

In hindsight, I realized I went to bed after **1:30 AM yesterday** because I was pumped about getting more prep time.  
I messed up my night routine, and as expected, I can’t function well if I sleep past midnight.  
I can’t even sleep in to recover because my body naturally wakes up around **7–8 AM.**

### 💡 Small but Important Win:
In the past, a **brain fog day** like this would’ve derailed my entire day.  
Today, after hours of struggling, I **recognized the hurdle** (poor sleep → low focus), shifted gears, and focused on **admin tasks.**  
Surprisingly, clearing those off helped lift the brain fog.

## ⚡ Key Challenge:
Even after regaining some clarity, I froze every time I tried to study my LeetCode Anki cards.  
Looking at the problem statement made me feel like I couldn’t breathe. I kept looping on:  
> _"What if I can’t recall the solution again?"_

Even though I had already gone through these cards multiple times, the fear of failing recall **paralyzed me.**

### 🛠️ Breakthrough:
I talked to ChatGPT about it, and it recommended:  
> **"If I can’t recall within 10–15 seconds, I must flip the card."**

This completely changed the game for me.  
Once I let go of the perfectionism trap and started flipping fast, I eased back into studying and broke the freeze cycle.
