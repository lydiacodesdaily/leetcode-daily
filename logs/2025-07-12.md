## 🧠 Reflections

I studied for **8.5 hours** today and completed **7 new LeetCode problems**, including some follow-ups and corrections after initial wrong attempts. Most were solved in Python and accepted after careful debugging.

## 📈 System Design Thoughts

I need to start focusing on **system design**, but I'm finding it daunting—just like how LeetCode felt when I first started.

I've explored:
- [Hello Interview](https://www.hellointerview.io/)
- Grokking the System Design Interview
- Several YouTube tutorials

While some of the content feels familiar, I’m still not confident that I understand it deeply. It feels like I *sort of* get it, but nothing has clicked yet. I plan to break things down further, study foundational components, and practice verbalizing my understanding to build true fluency.
