## 🔩 System Design Topics Covered

**🧠 Computer Architecture**
- Disk Storage: HDD vs SSD (SSD is faster and more expensive)
- RAM: Volatile memory for app data
- Cache: L1/L2/L3 → faster than RAM, checked first by CPU
- CPU: Executes compiled code
- Motherboard: Connects all components

**🚀 Production App Architecture**
- CI/CD pipeline deployment
- Load balancers for even traffic distribution
- External storage for production data
- Logging/Monitoring (e.g., Sentry, PM2)
- Alerts via Slack → Devs respond in staging, not production

**📐 Design Requirements**
- **CAP Theorem**: Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance (pick 2)
- **SLA/SLO**: Service reliability goals & guarantees
- Key metrics:
  - Throughput: RPS, QPS
  - Latency: Time per request
- Reliability, fault tolerance, and redundancy strategies

**🌐 Networking Basics**
- **IP Addresses**: IPv4 vs IPv6
- **Protocols**:
  - TCP (reliable, ordered)
  - UDP (faster, less reliable)
- DNS: Domain → IP translation
- Networking layers: Transport, Application, etc.

**🌍 Application Layer Protocols**
- HTTP (stateless, one-way)
- WebSockets (two-way real-time)
- MQTT/AMQP: IoT & message queuing
- RPC: Call remote services

**🔌 API Design**
- JSON vs XML
- REST principles (idempotency, versioning)
- Rate limiting, CORS, error codes

**⚡️ Caching and CDNs**
- **Cache Types**:
  - Browser (cache-control)
  - Server-side (write-around, write-through, write-back)
  - DB caching (check cache before querying DB)
- Eviction policies (e.g., LRU)
- **CDNs**:
  - Pull-based: auto-updated
  - Push-based: manually pushed content

**🛡 Proxy Servers**
- **Forward Proxy**: Sits in front of the client (privacy, filtering)
- **Reverse Proxy**: Sits in front of the server (load balancing, SSL, security)
- Special types: Transparent, Anonymous, Distorting, High-Anonymity

**🧮 Load Balancers**
- Algorithms:
  - Round Robin
  - Least Connections
  - IP Hash
  - Weighted
  - Health-aware
- Single point of failure mitigation: multi-LB setup, health checks, failover routing

**🗃 Databases**
- **Relational (SQL)**: ACID principles
- **NoSQL**: Flexible schema, high availability (MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra)
- Scaling:
  - Horizontal: Sharding, Replication
  - Vertical: More CPU/memory
- Performance:
  - Caching
  - Indexing
  - Query optimization

## 🧠 Reflections

I studied too late the night before and didn’t sleep well. So instead of pushing through a high-effort coding session, I pivoted and focused on watching the system design video I had queued up. It worked out well. **Knowing your body and being flexible helps maintain productivity without burnout.**

That said, I recognize that **pushing past my bedtime isn't sustainable**, even on good study streaks. My goal moving forward is to **wrap up by 10:30 PM**, no matter how focused I feel, to protect tomorrow’s energy and mental clarity.

## 🔭 What’s Next

- Rewatch parts of the system design video to reinforce concepts
- Start building a **visual note system** to organize these concepts
- Begin working through **interactive system design scenarios**
- Schedule short, focused sessions to practice diagramming
