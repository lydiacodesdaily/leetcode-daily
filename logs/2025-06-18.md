### ✅ Studied Problems:
1. [1539. Kth Missing Positive Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-missing-positive-number/)  
   • Pattern: Binary Search on missing count  
   • Mastered: `missing = arr[i] - (i + 1)`, condition `missing < k`, return `left + k`

2. [65. Valid Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-number/)  
   • Used regex for concise pattern matching, discussed state-machine approach as alternative.

3. [498. Diagonal Traverse](https://leetcode.com/problems/diagonal-traverse/)  
   • Simulation: Zig-zag traversal using `(i + j)` diagonals, reverse for even levels.

4. [249. Group Shifted Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-shifted-strings/submissions/1668606494/)  
   • Hashing pattern of char gaps modulo 26 to group rotationally equivalent strings.

5. [636. Exclusive Time of Functions](https://leetcode.com/problems/exclusive-time-of-functions/submissions/1668671624/)  
   • Stack-based simulation for start/end timestamps with nested calls.

6. [708. Insert into a Sorted Circular Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-into-a-sorted-circular-linked-list/)  
   • Key insight: insert between values, handle wrap-around, or insert after full loop.

7. [415. Add Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-strings/)  
   • Simulated digit-by-digit addition without converting to int.

8. [270. Closest Binary Search Tree Value](https://leetcode.com/problems/closest-binary-search-tree-value/)  
   • Pattern: BST search, keep track of closest value.

9. [378. Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-sorted-matrix/)  
   • Pattern: Binary Search on value range + helper `countLessEqual()` function.

10. [219. Contains Duplicate II](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate-ii/)  
    • Explored both `last_seen` map and dynamic sliding window `set` approaches.  
    • Preferred pattern-based sliding window with set.

11. [523. Continuous Subarray Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/continuous-subarray-sum/)  
    • Mastered prefix sum mod trick: `prefix[j] % k == prefix[i] % k` → same remainder → multiple of k.

### 🧠 Memory Hook Rewrites:
- Refined memory hook structure to only highlight **what’s unique** vs generic templates.
- Removed unnecessary keywords field in favor of sharper, broken-form memory hooks

### 🛠️ Anki Flashcard Maintenance:
- Updated multiple flashcards to include:
• Base pattern, subtype, unique condition logic, key return formulas  
• Clean grouped code blocks + dry run examples  
• Memory hooks optimized for fast recall during interviews

### 💡 Notable Wins:
- Had breakthrough moment with prefix sum modulo logic  
- Identified subtle union-find bug in `accounts-merge` and fixed it with correct `union()` placement  
- Chose to prioritize pattern-aligned solutions (e.g., set-based sliding window) even over slightly simpler ones to improve consistency and recall
